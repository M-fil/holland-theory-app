## Assignment
Create a web-based instrument that reliably and accurately 
measures the Holland/RIASEC typology. The Holland Occupational Themes 
is a theory of personality that focuses on career and vocational 
choice. It groups people on the basis of their suitability for six 
different categories of occupations. The six types yield the RIASEC 
acronym, by which the theory is also commonly known. The theory was 
developed by John L. Holland over the course of his career, starting 
in the 1950s. The typology has come to dominate the field of career 
counseling and has been incorporated into most of the popular 
assessments used in the field.

Using client-side scripting (responsive HTML5+CSS+JS) the goal is to 
develop an assessment tool based on Holland's theory to be used for 
self-exploratory purposes, helping users discovering and expanding 
their career interest patterns. The tool should incorporate strong 
psychometric characteristics, develop reliable scales, gather evidence 
of measurement and construct validity, and design an instrument format 
that users can understand and score accurately.
